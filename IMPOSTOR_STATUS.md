# 🎯 Octahedral Impostor - Current Status

## ✅ What's Ready

### Files Implemented

- ✅ `src/octahedral-impostor/` - Full repository code copied
- ✅ `src/components/MountainImpostorProper.tsx` - R3F wrapper
- ✅ `vite.config.js` - GLSL plugin configured
- ✅ `vite-plugin-glsl` - Installed
- ✅ Integrated into `ParkourCourseMap5.tsx`

### Changes Applied

- ✅ Water shader **disabled** (to clear console errors)
- ✅ Performance stats positioned **middle-left**
- ✅ Mountain material handles models **with or without textures**

## 🧪 Current Test Configuration

### Map5 Settings

```tsx
<MountainImpostorProper
  position={[0, -0.5, 50]} // Behind the map
  scale={1}
  useImpostor={true}
  modelPath="/models/mountain.glb"
/>
```

### Leva Controls

**🏔️ Mountain Impostor (Map5)**

- Use Impostor: ON ✅
- Position: X=0, Y=-0.5, Z=50
- Scale: 1

## 🔍 What to Check

### In Browser Console:

1. **Look for**: "Failed to create impostor" error

   - ✅ If NO error → Impostor is working!
   - ❌ If error → Share the full error message

2. **Ignore**: Water shader errors (those are unrelated)

### In the Game:

1. **Look for**: Mountain in the distance (Z=50)
2. **Try toggling**: Use Impostor ON/OFF
   - Should see mountain appear/disappear or change

## 🎮 Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check Console

```
Open browser console (F12)
Look for:
✅ "Creating impostor for mountain..."
OR
❌ "Failed to create impostor: [error]"
```

### Step 2: Find the Mountain

```
In game:
- Move camera to look at Z=50 direction
- Should see brown mountain
- Try different positions in Leva if not visible
```

### Step 3: Performance Test

```
Toggle "Use Impostor":
- ON: Should render as billboard
- OFF: Should render as full 3D model
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Water Shader Errors (NOT Impostor Related)

```
TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined
at WaterShaderQuickGrass.tsx:448
```

**Status**: Disabled water shader to isolate impostor testing
**Fix**: You can re-enable water later after impostor works

### Possible Impostor Issues

**If mountain is invisible:**

- Try adjusting Z position (move closer: Z=20)
- Try increasing scale (scale=5)
- Check browser console for errors

**If shader errors persist:**

- Make sure dev server was restarted
- Check that vite-plugin-glsl is in node_modules
- Verify GLSL files have content (not empty)

## 📊 Expected Performance

Once working:

**With Impostor ON:**

- FPS: High (60+)
- Triangles: Very low (~2)
- Draw calls: 1

**With Impostor OFF:**

- FPS: Lower
- Triangles: Higher (~100k)
- Draw calls: Multiple

## 💬 What to Report Back

Please check and let me know:

1. **Console errors?** (Share any errors NOT related to water shader)
2. **Mountain visible?** (Yes/No)
3. **Performance stats showing?** (Middle-left position)
4. **Toggle works?** (Impostor ON vs OFF)

**The proper implementation is ready - just need to verify it's rendering!** 🚀
