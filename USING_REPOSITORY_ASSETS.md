# ✅ Now Using Repository's Exact Assets!

## 🎯 What Changed

Following your advice, I've updated the implementation to use the **EXACT same assets** from the [agargaro/octahedral-impostor](https://github.com/agargaro/octahedral-impostor) repository!

---

## 📦 Current Configuration

### Asset Being Used

```typescript
modelPath = "/octahedral-impostor-main/public/tree.glb";
```

**This is the EXACT tree model from the repository!**

### Settings (Same as Repository Example)

```typescript
{
  renderer: gl,                  // WebGL renderer
  target: treeScene,             // tree.glb from repo
  useHemiOctahedron: true,       // Same as repo
  transparent: false,            // Same as repo
  spritesPerSide: 8,             // Same as repo
  textureSize: 2048,             // Reduced from 8192 (for speed)
  alphaClamp: 0.4,               // Same as repo
  baseType: MeshBasicMaterial    // Same as repo
}
```

---

## 🌳 What to Expect

### The Tree Model

- **From**: octahedral-impostor repository
- **Type**: Low-poly tree with leaves
- **Has**: Textures and alpha transparency
- **Perfect for**: Testing octahedral impostor technique

### Visual

```
     🌿
    🌿🌿🌿
   🌿🌿🌿🌿
    🌿🌿🌿
      │││  ← Tree trunk
      │││
     ─┴┴┴─
```

Should see a green tree with billboard effect!

---

## 🎮 Updated Controls

### Leva Panel

**"🌳 Tree Impostor (Map5) - Repository Asset"**

- **Use Impostor**: Toggle ON/OFF
- **Position X**: 0 (centered)
- **Position Y**: -0.5 (ground level)
- **Position Z**: 50 (in front of player)
- **Scale**: 1 (original size)

---

## 🔍 What to Check Now

### 1. Browser Console

Look for:

```
🚀 Creating octahedral impostor...
Target mesh: Object3D { ... }  ← Should show tree
Renderer: WebGLRenderer { ... }
✅ Impostor created successfully!
```

### 2. In Game

You should see:

- ✅ **Green tree** with leaves
- ✅ Tree billboard facing camera
- ✅ Toggle works (tree vs impostor)
- ✅ NO shader errors (if restarted server)

### 3. Performance Stats

Middle-left should show:

- FPS: High (60+)
- Draw Calls: Low
- Triangles: Very low with impostor

## 🚀 Why This Is Better for Debugging

### Same as Repository ✅

| Component            | Repository        | Our Implementation        |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Model**            | tree.glb          | ✅ tree.glb (exact same!) |
| **Material**         | MeshBasicMaterial | ✅ MeshBasicMaterial      |
| **Hemi Octahedron**  | true              | ✅ true                   |
| **Sprites Per Side** | 8                 | ✅ 8                      |
| **Alpha Clamp**      | 0.4               | ✅ 0.4                    |

### Differences (Optimized)

- **Texture Size**: 8192 → 2048 (faster baking, still good quality)
- **Wrapper**: vanilla Three.js → React Three Fiber

## 📝 Test Checklist

After refresh:

- [ ] Select `map5(copy)`
- [ ] Look for tree at Z=50
- [ ] Check console for success message
- [ ] Toggle impostor ON/OFF
- [ ] Watch performance stats
- [ ] NO shader compilation errors

---

## 💡 After It Works

Once the tree impostor is confirmed working:

1. **We know the system works!** ✅
2. **Can switch back to mountain.glb** (your model)
3. **Can create multiple instances** (forest!)
4. **Can optimize settings** for your game

---

**Now you're using the EXACT same setup as the repository!** 🎯

This makes debugging 100x easier because we can compare directly with their example.

Check the console and let me know what you see! 🌳🚀
