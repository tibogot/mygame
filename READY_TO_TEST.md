# 🎯 READY TO TEST - Repository Assets!

## ✅ EVERYTHING NOW USES REPOSITORY ASSETS!

You were 100% right! For proper debugging, we're now using the **EXACT same files** as the [agargaro/octahedral-impostor](https://github.com/agargaro/octahedral-impostor) repository.

---

## 🌳 What's Using Repository Assets

### Model

```
✅ tree.glb from /octahedral-impostor-main/public/tree.glb
❌ NOT using your mountain.glb
```

### Code

```
✅ All shaders from repository
✅ All core classes from repository
✅ All utility functions from repository
```

### Settings

```
✅ useHemiOctahedron: true (same as repo)
✅ spritesPerSide: 8 (same as repo)
✅ alphaClamp: 0.4 (same as repo)
✅ baseType: MeshBasicMaterial (same as repo)
```

**Only difference:** Using React Three Fiber wrapper instead of vanilla Three.js

---

## 🎮 How to Test

### Step 1: Refresh Browser

- Clear all cached errors
- Dev server should be running

### Step 2: Select Map5

- In Leva: Select `map5(copy)`

### Step 3: Check Console (F12)

Look for:

```
🚀 Creating octahedral impostor...
Target mesh: Group { ... }  ← Tree model
Renderer: WebGLRenderer { ... }
✅ Impostor created successfully! OctahedralImpostor { ... }
```

### Step 4: Find the Tree

**Leva Controls: "🌳 Tree Impostor (Map5) - Repository Asset"**

Current position: X=0, Y=-0.5, Z=50

If you don't see it:

- Try Z=20 (bring closer)
- Try Scale=5 (make bigger)
- Try Y=1 (lift up)

### Step 5: Toggle Test

- **Turn OFF** "Use Impostor" → Should see full 3D tree
- **Turn ON** "Use Impostor" → Should see billboard tree

---

## 🔍 What You Should See

### With Impostor ON ✅

```
🌳 Green tree billboard
   - Faces camera
   - 2 triangles
   - High FPS
   - Looks like a tree from all angles
```

### With Impostor OFF ❌

```
🌳 Full 3D tree
   - Actual geometry
   - Many triangles
   - Lower FPS
   - Full 3D model
```

---

## 📊 Expected Console Output

### Success Case:

```
🚀 Creating octahedral impostor...
Target mesh: Group {uuid: "...", name: "", type: "Group", ...}
Renderer: WebGLRenderer {_isContextLost: false, ...}
✅ Impostor created successfully! OctahedralImpostor {
  geometry: PlaneGeometry,
  material: MeshBasicMaterial,
  position: Vector3(0, -0.5, 50),
  ...
}
```

### Error Case:

```
❌ Failed to create impostor: Error: [specific error]
```

**Share the specific error if you see one!**

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "GLSL module not found"

**Fix**: Make sure dev server was restarted after installing vite-plugin-glsl

### Issue: "tree.glb not loading"

**Fix**: Check that file exists at `public/octahedral-impostor-main/public/tree.glb`

### Issue: Tree invisible

**Fix**: Adjust position in Leva:

- Z: 50 → 10 (much closer)
- Scale: 1 → 10 (much bigger)
- Y: -0.5 → 2 (above ground)

### Issue: Shader errors

**Fix**: Check browser console for specific GLSL errors

## 📝 What to Report

Please check and tell me:

1. **Console output?**

   - ✅ "Impostor created successfully!"
   - OR ❌ "Failed to create impostor: [error]"

2. **Tree visible?**

   - Yes/No
   - If yes: Billboard or 3D model?

3. **Performance stats showing?**

   - Yes (middle-left)
   - No

4. **Any errors?**
   - Share ONLY impostor-related errors
   - Ignore water shader errors

---

## 🌟 Why This Setup is Perfect

✅ **Same model as repository** (tree.glb)  
✅ **Same shaders as repository** (all GLSL files)  
✅ **Same settings as repository** (hemi, sprites, etc.)  
✅ **Only wrapper is different** (R3F instead of vanilla)

This means if there's an issue, it's 100% isolated to the R3F wrapper, not the core implementation!

---

**Check your console now and let me know what you see!** 🌳🚀

The tree impostor should work exactly like the repository example!
